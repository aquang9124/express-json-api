# API

This is a Restful Node/Express API that I made so I could quickly add a backend to my apps. However, it kinda got expanded to become basically a skeleton for future projects.

## Usage

It passes all of the tests given and will be useful for quick implementation of log in and registration features.

## Note to self

- Don't forgot to start up MongoDB.
- Don't forget to run npm install
- Don't forget to run bower install
